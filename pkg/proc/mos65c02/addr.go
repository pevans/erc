// Ind resolves the indirect address mode. If you can imagine that the

// Idx resolves the indexed indirect address mode, which resolves to a

// page--which may not come up too often because you don't have a ton of
// space in the zero page to work with. But I can imagine operating
// system code that could use this quite often.
//
// Ex. INC ($NN,X) resolves $NN + X as <addr1>; then looks up <addr1>

// Idy resolves the indirect indexed address mode, which is essentially

// Ex. INC ($NN),Y looks up $NN and resolves that to <addr1>; then looks
// up <addr1>, and resolves that + Y as <addr2>; then saves <addr2> as
// the effective address and the looked-up byte at <addr2>.

// Rel resolves the relative address mode. This is only used by branch
// instructions, and lets you define an offset of -128..127 that the
// branch instructions can jump to. Note the given operand is, uniquely
// among other address modes, a _signed_ 8-bit operand. If you imagine
// that JSR and JMP enable long-range jumps, then the branches (via REL)
// enable short-range jumps both forwards and backwards.
//
// Ex. BEQ COUNTER (where "COUNTER" is some label that compiles to a
// signed byte offset) will jump to COUNTER if the Z status is set;
// otherwise, no action is taken besides stepping past the branch
// instruction.

	// address yet. We want the uint16-ness of addresses in the MOS 6502
	// to force overflow to work as expected: going from FFFF to 0000,
	// or 0000 to FFFF. We add 2 more bytes to account for the (fixed)
	// size of all branch instruction sequences, which is one byte for
	// the opcode and one byte for the operand.
	addr := c.PC + data.DByte(change) + 2

	// Because negative numbers in the MOS 6502 are encoded with
	// twos-complement, if change has its eigth bit set to 1, then we
