// hiresRows maps a set of rows to a set of addresses. Your column, for
// any given point, is always the address mod $40, so there's no need
// for any complex mapping there.
//
// Rows are interleaved into three sections, broken up by 8 rows. As you
// can see, you have rows 0, 8, 16; then 1, 9, 17; etc. Note that $80
// addresses (the length of each segment) is 128, but 3 rows of 40
// columns is only 120. The last 8 spaces are always reserved by Apple
// II, and don't technically map to anything on the screen. We use a -1
// to signal that an address in those ranges should be ignored.
