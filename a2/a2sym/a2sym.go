// a2sym provides symbols that are used or define in Apple II technical
// literature. These symbols are not necessary to emulate an Apple II, but are
// informational and useful for debugging.

// For example, the Subroutine method can tell you that a JSR to $FE2C is
// actually calling the built-in subroutine, MOVE.
