// a2state provides a set of consts that you can use to reference state
// in the Apple II. Typically, these consts are keys in a StateMap. For
// example, you might use DisplayHires to see if the computer is
// currently displaying hires graphics.
//
// There is, additionally, support to return a string form of these
// state keys. The string form of these state keys is not useful for
// general operation of an emulated Apple II device, but may be useful
// for debugging.
