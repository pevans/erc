// a2state provides a set of consts that you can use to reference state in the
// Apple II. Typically, these consts are keys in a StateMap. For example, you
// might use DisplayHires to see if the computer is currently displaying hires
// graphics.
//
// There is, additionally, support to return a string form of these state
// keys. The string form of these state keys is not useful for general
// operation of an emulated Apple II device, but may be useful for debugging.
